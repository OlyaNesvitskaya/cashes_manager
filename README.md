## Description

When the main page loads, a list of cashbox profiles will be displayed; the table is generated
by re-reading the physical directory profiles (path 'checkbox.kasa.manager\profiles'). 
Each folder name corresponds to the name field, the path field is filled in with the full path to the profile. 
Getting the value for the port field - open the config.json file (it is stored in each profile folder).
The remaining fields are optional and filled in by user. If the profile is not in the database, add it,
if it is mysite\in the database but not in the catalog, delete it.
